Revision history for Perl module Distribution::Guess::BuildSystem

1.002 2018-03-30T15:27:59Z
	* Bump to user release

1.001_02 2018-03-26T21:05:27Z
	* internal method _get_version returns a defined value even
	when the target module is not install.

1.001_01 2018-03-26T17:41:00Z
	* Allow Windows tests to look for gmake too. Strawberry Perl 
	switched to that awhile ago.

1.001 2016-06-07T18:30:21Z
	* Bump to full release

0.12_02 - 2014-01-06
	* Update META information and *_REQUIRES

0.12_01 - 2010-11-13
	* One of the test regexes to check the perl %Config for
	make assumed that it was only the basename. I adjusted
	it to deal with paths, like C:\\Perl\\bin\\dmake.exe

0.12 - 2010-09-28
	* Add preferred_* commands so you can get a single answer
	(instead of a hash) that tells you which command to
	use to setup and build a dist.

0.11 - 2008-10-29
	* Changes to use the new Module::Extract::Use interface,
	which doesn't use class methods anymore.

0.10_02 - 2008-08-04
	* Add just_give_me_a_hash() to get a hash of all of the method
	names and what they would return. This way you get all of the
	info you'd want right away and you can store it immediately.

0.10_01 - 2008-08-02
	* first release of a module to guess the build system on a
	Perl module distribution
